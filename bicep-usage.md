    + *Product View*
        - After selecting a product in the Store View, you'll see information about it in the Product View.
        ![](images/bicep-usage8.png)

            + This is the *product sidebar*
                - The *Product Page* button opens the BigCommerce product page in a new tab.
                - The sidebar also indicates:
                    + When the product was created
                    + Whether it is available or preorder
                    + Total views for this product.
                    + Sales total for this product.
                        - A high view total with a low sales total indicates that this is not a product people want.
