### **How it works:**

We create a separate webstore with a massively simplified, tablet-specific user interface, with a product for each type you plan to offer at live events, i.e. *Shirt*, *Tote*, *Stickers*, etc.

Transactions proceed through the same process as on the live webstore. Desired products are added to the cart as normal and orders pass through the standard checkout process, collecting all required compliance information.

At the end of the checkout process, the order is created in BigCommerce but the transaction is directed to the Square Point of Sale application for processing.

The POS operator is prompted to select a tender type (cash or card), and if the choice is *card*, the operator will be asked to swipe/insert card. Manual entry is also an option.

Once the transaction is complete, the Square Point of Sale application will send the transaction result data back to BigCommerce, to a *Transaction Result* page.

This page will display the received transaction data: *Order Number*, *Transaction ID*, and if applicable, information about any errors or declined transactions.

We display these for operator benefit; if an error occurs, the system will display useful diagnostic information as we can not really provide on-site tech support for the POS webstore.

From the *Transaction Result* page, the operator can easily return to the homepage of the POS webstore to begin checking out the next person.

### **What you need:**

- A Square account
- The Square Point of Sale app installed on all tablets
- Tablets (either all Android or all Apple, as each requires drastically different coding)
- Uninterrupted Internet Access
- A wireless keyboard for each tablet

The operators MUST use the Square account to log into the Square Point of Sale application before processing any transactions. Otherwise, the revenue will not go into the bank account specified in the Square account. This would be very bad. You can be logged into the same account for multiple devices, so that is not an issue. I'm not sure exactly about the maximum amount of devices that can use the Square account simultaneously, but we've run four at a time without difficulty.

For the tablets, there are a few things to consider. We've had the best experience using mid-grade iPads that fit into the Square Stand. The Square Stand includes a charging port to keep tablets powered, ideal display angle, the ability to swivel around to face the customer and back to the operator, and an integrated card reader. Swiveling is a cool (but perhaps not all-important) feature, but maintaining power to the tablets is essential and should not be overlooked.

I also mentioned the display angle of the Stand. This is something that can also get overlooked, but after much testing is more important than it may appear at first glance. If these terminals are to be used for hours at a time, event after event, having them simply placed on a tabletop with power cords dangling from the side can cause additional issues.

The power cord can get pulled accidentally and send the tablet flying to the floor. At that point, you're probably down a terminal for the remainder of the event, causing longer lines for the remaining tablets.

If operators are struggling with an unwieldy set up, transactions can take longer than is perhaps ideal. At the volume of a thousand transactions, those seconds can surely add up quickly. Square has a wealth of hardware options to aid you in configuring your set up, I just want to highlight that these usability issues merit consideration as we roll this system out.

For Android tablets, there are so many manufacturers, shapes, sizes and variations that I recommend consulting this handy compatibility guide. I also recommend getting the same model of tablet for all terminals to keep the system as standard and uniform as possible.

Uninterrupted internet access is required, as without it, Square is not able to processing transactions properly. Technically, the Square Point of Sale app can process transactions after the fact once the tablets regain internet access, but by that time the customer has already departed with the merchandise and if their transaction is declined, they get their merchandise for free. I suggest avoiding that situation at all costs by ensuring a steady internet connection.

Wireless keyboards are strongly recommended, as the checkout process (particularly the entry of customer information) can be cumbersome if relying solely on the tablet's on-screen keyboard. The key is to make each transaction as quick as possible, and entering customer compliance information is much faster on a physical keyboard. We've had good experiences with Bluetooth-connected wireless keyboards from Logitech.

### **What we need from you:**

Once you get your Square account set up, you will need to create an Application on the Square Developer Portal. I will need the *Application ID* and *Location ID* generated for your Application in order to connect the POS webstore to your Square account. When that time comes, I can provide more specific information on what we're looking for and where you can find it.

At that point, I'll have one more minor task for you to handle, and then we'll essentially be up and running. We can cross that bridge once we reach it, I don't want to bombard you with too much information up front!

Let me know what you think and we'll proceed accordingly. If you have any further questions or I've left anything unclear, just let me know and I will clarify!
