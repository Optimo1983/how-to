# Square Developer Account Setup

- [Go here](https://squareup.com/login) to register for your Square account. Fill out the required information and add the campaign bank account to your Square account.

- Once your account has been created, you will need to also create a Square Developer account to be able to use their Point of Sale API.

- [Here](https://squareup.com/signup?v=developers) is a link to the Square Developer account signup.

- Log in using the credentials you set up for the Square account.

- You will be directed to a landing page with a blue **New Application** button. Click it.

- Enter a name for the new application and click **Create Application**.

- You'll then be taken to a page which displays an **Application ID**. I will need to get this ID from you.

- In the nav on the left-hand side, there will be a listing for **Locations**. Click on this.

- If a location already exists, I will need the **Location ID**. If not, a Location will need to be created.

- That is pretty much the extent of the setup required, aside from adding bank account info.

- Once we get the Application ID and Location ID added to our codebase, I'll reach back out to you with a **Web Callback URL**.

- You'll need to plug this value into the **Web Callback URLs** field in the **Point of Sale API** section of the developer dashboard.
