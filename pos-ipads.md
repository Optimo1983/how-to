# Point of Sale - iPad Setup

## POS URL

- If you would like to set up a CNAME pointer to give the POS an address like pos.client.org, we can definitely do that, provided you've got the bandwidth to set up a CNAME pointer before Wednesday. If not, we can revisit that issue down the line.

- In the meantime, you will access the POS via the Safari web browser at `https://client-pos.mybigcommerce.com/`.

- This URL is publicly available on the internet for anyone to view. However, transactions can only be processed by tablets that have the Square Point Of Sale downloaded, and are logged in using the campaign Square Account username and password.

- Without the square app or login credentials, a transaction cannot be processed.

## SETTING UP THE IPAD

- When you power up a new iPad for the first time, you will need to associate it with the campaign's Apple ID and enter the password.

- This password credential should be shared with Senior Merch supervisors, but not rank and file volunteers. In other words, this is a medium security level password.

    + Controlling Apple ID: ________________

    + Password:  ____________

    + Associated Cell Phone Account:  _____________________

- When setting up a new iPad you need to coordinate with the owner of the Associated Cell Phone first.

- You will need to enter Apple ID and password to setup the iPad. Then the Associated Cell Phone will receive a Verification Code. You will need to connect with that person, so that he or she will know to forward the verification code to you.

- Billing address associated with the iCloud account is:

    + ___________________

    + ___________________

    + ___________________

- This billing address should only be needed when setting up the account and shouldn't been required when setting up additional tablets, but it's included here for reference / just in case.

## NAME THE IPAD WITH A UNIQUE ID

- This is a one-time chore, after setup.

- We also want to give each iPad a unique name. This way, we will be able to uniquely identify it if we use the "Find My iPad" feature in iCloud. Find My iPad will show a map of the latest recorded location of *all* of the iPads, which will be of help in case any iPad ever gets lost.

- Having unique names for the iPads can also help us diagnose and troubleshoot should anything go awry. The device name will also appear in the itemized Square transaction records, so if we see recurring issues from the same iPad, we can narrow down possible causes for that issue.

- To give the iPad a unique name, go to **Settings** > **General** > **About** > **Name**.

- For the first iPads, we recommend naming them as follows:

    + ABCD Merch 1, ABCD Merch 2, ABCD Merch 3

- **PRO TIP:** We recommend putting a sticker (or a piece of tape with writing on it) with the name/number of each iPad on the iPad.

- We also recommend putting a sticker with the *same* name/number on the Logitech Bluetooth Keyboards associated with each iPad. Bluetooth settings can be finicky, and if the keyboards are swapped out among the various iPads, it can result in connection headaches.

- Basically, once we do a bluetooth link between a keyboard and an iPad, we want to make sure that that particular keyboard stays associated with its iPad, or potential bluetooth connection issues could arise. If bluetooth connection issues do arise, you can tell the tablet to 'forget' any previously connected bluetooth keyboards and then find/re-pair with the target keyboard.

## DOWNLOADING THE SQUARE APP

- In the Apple App store, download the free **Square Point Of Sale (POS)** app.

- **NOTE:** There are a number of Square apps, including a very similarly named one called *Square Retail POS*. We have to use the one that is simply named **Square Point of Sale (POS)**.

- Once downloaded, click on the app. You will be prompted to login or register. Click login.

**1.** Login with the Square Account email and password.

    Email:  ____________________

    Password:  ______________

**2.** After the login is successful, accept *all* of the prompts Square will offer, including *allow location tracking* and *enable microphone*.

If these prompts aren't accepted, the Square reader won't work. It will throw an error instructing you where to go in the iPad settings to enable the permissions, but it's much simpler to just accept the prompts that Square gives you when logging in to the account for the first time.

## SETTING UP THE BLUE TOOTH KEYBOARD

**1.** Go to **Settings** > **Bluetooth**.

**2.** Hold down the IOS Connect Button in the top left of the keyboard.

**3.** The name of the keyboard should appear in the iPad **Available Bluetooth Devices** menu. Select the keyboard, and then it should connect.

**4.** If you're having trouble connecting, there is a *1-2-3 channel dial* on the top left of the Logitech K480 keyboard. Switch to a different channel and try connecting again with the above steps.

## FINDING THE IPADS IN ICLOUD

- You can view the last recorded location of all the iPads via using the Find My Ipad App at iCloud.com.

**1.** Go to www.icloud.com in Safari.

**2.** Enter the Apple ID and Password:

    Apple ID: _______________

    Password: _____________

- **NOTE:** Entering in this user name and password will trigger a "second factor id" password being sent the Associated Cell Phone.

- The "Find my iPhone" feature does *NOT* require entering in the second factor id, only the more advanced iCloud features do. However, you should know that any time you do find my iPad, the Associated Cell Phone will get pinged. So it's likely a good idea to send the Associated Cell Phone owner a text before using this feature, so he or she will understand who is accessing the iCloud account, and why.
